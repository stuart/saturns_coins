This package is designed to be built using Nasher.
https://github.com/squattingmonk/nasher
You will have to configure the flags setting in nasher.cfg to point to your
installation of NWN.

I have wrapped calls to Nasher in a Makefile for convenience.
To build do this in the command line:

  make all

make erf, make hak, make module and make tlk all just call nasher.

make clean will remove any build artifacts for you.

make readme will convert the README to html. You will need pandoc installed
to do that.

make release will create a release zip file. It takes the version number from
nasher.cfg.

make install copies all the files to their places in your NWN directory.
You may have to change the directory name in the Makefile.
